# ForMrsSade[Excel Automation script]
A python script for automation of excel documents. 

I was given a task to create sub sheets from a master excel sheet to be used with PSS Sincal software. I used my python skills to write a script that automates the task. This decreased time taken from 5 minutes to 30 seconds per sub sheet. There were over 400 sub sheets to be completed and this initiative cut down processing time by 90% while minimizing error.

Required libraries
-pandas
-openpyxl
