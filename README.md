A python script for automation of excel documents. 

I was given a task to create sub sheets from a master excel sheet to be used with PSS Sincal software. I used my python skills to write a pandas script that automates the task. This decreased time taken from 5 minutes to 30 seconds per sub sheet. There were over 400 sub sheets to be completed and this initiative increased operational efficiency by 1900%.

Required libraries
-pandas
-openpyxl
